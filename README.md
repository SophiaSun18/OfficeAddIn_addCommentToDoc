* Example - Extract text from document: https://developers.google.com/docs/api/samples/extract-text#python

## Next step:
* keep working on the anchor and the region classifier, hopefully figure out how to make it work to locate where i want to put a new comment in the text
* how to immediately get and store the region classifier of a q-word while reading the document and a q-word is found?
* consider using the length parameter in the region classifier to keep track of the length of the q-word

## Optional:
* clean up the first part (or the second part) to make the program use only one API (if possible)
